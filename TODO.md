## Next Dev Tasks

- each book should only appear in one of want to read / currently reading / already read. Right now on import I see a book duplicated currently reading and want to read. Is it a duplicate or an import problem?
- Currently reading cards should not have the "add to next up"
- ability to categorize a book as fiction/non-fiction
- button to guess fiction/non-fiction for all uncategorized books
- use hardened containers
- design style
