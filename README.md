# Books

I want to make an app to track the books I read.

Key features:

- books are categorized as one of already read, currently reading, or want to read in the future
- usable on my phone and laptop, same data shared between both
- private: only I should be able to access the data
- super quick and easy to use
- list of books I've read with cover thumbnails and dates when I started and finished
- queue of books I want to read with a notes field so I can remember how I heard about it or who recommended it
- fiction / nonfiction is an important distinction to me because I often want to be reading one fiction and one non-fiction book at a time, so maybe these are like labels/tags on books but they should be prominent
- There should be 2 "next up" short lists (no more than 10 each). These are subsets of the queue of books I want to read. One "Next up: Fiction" and another "Next up: Nonfiction".
- it should be easy to sort the next up lists with drag-and-drop
- it should be easy to add and remove books I want to read in the future to/from the next up lists
- open source, self-hosted, careful secrets management

Features of lower importance:

These can come later. Not necessary for MVP.

- ad hoc lists of books
- sharing of reviews and book lists
- multiple users in a single instance, requiring authentication and authorization
